A friend had just bought this model of Oakley sunglasses and I thought it would be fun to build something around them. The main struggle was getting the AI to keep the model of the glasses true to the real thing without distorting the shape or the details. It took a lot of back and forth to land on takes that actually felt faithful to the product.

In the end it was a fun project that opened a door for me into this AI world, and it set the stage for the bigger, more structured exercise I later did with Chut.`,
